 * Error thrown when there is no adapter-specific response object available to read. This usually happens due to one
 * of the following:
 *   - The request is aborted by signal.
 *   - Invalid options are passed to the adapter.
 *   - The response is unreadable because of a security violation (e.g. CORS).
 *   - The response is unreadable because the caller is asking for parsed JSON and the Content-Type is not JSON.
